This is a simple board game built as a mandatory task for Binus University New Assistant Recruitment 18-1, Pre-Training Phase, C subject. If code sharing is not allowed as per the University rules, please let me know immediately through the contact given on the header of this readme!

# Supported Platforms

Only Windows as it is heavily reliant on SetConsoleCursorPosition(HANDLE, COORD) that is only available in Windows. If you have a substitute function for macOS/Linux/whatever please let me know through the contact given :)

# How this works

The algorithm contained/used here is pretty simple, it takes nothing more than for loops, string.h functions, ctype.h functions and very basic input output and file read/write. TL;DR, it's all primitives.

# How to Compile

The program only comprise of one file. While I could have done this in multiple files, but I decided to shy away from it to avoid any error from happening, hence the monstrous source file XD

# Got Bugs?

Please contact me and tell me how to reproduce it, otherwise I don't know how to fix it.
